# Library Project

This library project allows students at California Polytechnic State University to sign up for library reservations automatically, even allowing users to keep this program ongoing to allow for automatic signup whenever a spot opens.

## Installation

First, check to see if Selenium is installed on by using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

```bash
pip3 --version
```

If not installed, install pip (for Mac)

```bash
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python3 get-pip.py
```

Then, install Selenium

```bash
pip3 install selenium
```

## Usage

After running the file, the user will be able to input their
- First name
- Last name
- School email
- Group (if applicable)

doing so runs the program and signs the user up for the next avaliable reservation spot, or a specified time, if wanted.
